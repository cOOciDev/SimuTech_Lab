- **C#**: Primary programming language for handling logic, behaviors, and interactions.
- **Physics Engine**: Used for simulating realistic ship movements, interactions, and chemical experiments.
- **UI Toolkit**: For creating interactive UI elements to control and monitor various experiments and simulations.
- **Custom Asset Packs**: For ships, engines, and objects within the simulation.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites:
- **Unity 2022** (or the version youâ€™re developing on)
- **Git** (for version control)

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SimuTech-Lab.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Unity:
    - Launch Unity Hub.
    - Click "Add" and select the project folder.
    - Open the project.

3. Ensure the required packages are installed (e.g., physics, UI).
    - Unity will automatically prompt you to install any missing packages when you first open the project.

4. Build and run:
    - From the **File** menu, select **Build Settings**.
    - Choose your target platform (e.g., PC, WebGL, etc.).
    - Click **Build and Run** to start the simulation.

## How to Play/Use
- **Ship Simulation**: Use the on-screen controls to navigate your ship, adjust the engine settings, and test the ship's response to different conditions.
- **Chemical Experiment**: Select chemical reagents and interact with the environment to observe the outcomes. Each experiment is designed to be educational and provide real-time feedback.
- **Custom Settings**: Navigate through the simulation settings to adjust difficulty, control schemes, and experiment parameters.
